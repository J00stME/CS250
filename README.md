How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  In order to succeed with a project in any agile framework, a working product backlog must be created.  This log is made up of different features that will be implemented.  It is easy to create a good backlog
  if 'user stories' are created beforehand.  They are conversations with the user or customer about their desired features, which can be translated to actual milestones.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  Best practices employ developing programs incrementally and testing them thoroughly within each increment.  It is better to fix a problem early than to face major refactoring.  Encapsulated programs should interact with each other in predictable ways
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Good team members can understand the needs and responsibilites of any other team member and communicate/ask questions as often as they can.  Stay on task and be available!
